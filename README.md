# Weather-Scale-Converter
My project provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for converting temperatures between different weather scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This project uses Java Swing to create a user-friendly interface for entering a temperature value, selecting the input scale, and converting it to the desired output scale.
